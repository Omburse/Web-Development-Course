        <h2>Shivaji Maharaj History</h2>
        <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was one of the greatest rulers in Indian history and the founder of the Maratha Empire. He was born on 19 February 1630 at Shivneri Fort in Maharashtra. His father, Shahaji Bhosale, was a general, and his mother, Jijabai, greatly influenced his character by teaching him values of courage, justice, and devotion. From a young age, Shivaji showed leadership qualities and a strong desire to establish self-rule, known as “Hindavi Swarajya.”

At the age of sixteen, Shivaji captured Torna Fort, marking the beginning of the Maratha Empire. He gradually captured many forts and built a strong army using smart military strategies, especially guerrilla warfare, which involved surprise attacks and quick movements. One of the most famous events in his life was the defeat of Afzal Khan in 1659. He also fought many battles against the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. In 1666, he was arrested in Agra but escaped cleverly.

In 1674, Shivaji Maharaj was crowned as Chhatrapati at Raigad Fort. He was not only a brave warrior but also a wise administrator. He formed the Ashta Pradhan (council of eight ministers), promoted religious tolerance, protected women, and built a strong navy to safeguard the coastal areas. Shivaji Maharaj passed away on 3 April 1680, but his legacy of bravery, good governance, and patriotism continues to inspire people across India.
